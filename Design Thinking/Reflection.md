### A. What you have gained
Design thinking project for this subject is one of the main objective. I learned a lot from it because before this I never know anything about design thinking. In this design thinking process we completed a lot of task such as report, prototype and pitching. It enhances my knowledge and I think after this I will use a lot of design thinking process because it makes thing more simple, orderly and compact with the best outcome.

### B. Suggest any improvement
I think the only things that hinder us from make a better design thinking prototype is because of lack of information and past year example. It will be really helpful if have these informations.

### C. Others
While in the process of design thinking I am lucky to have such a great group members but I kind of sad for my friend that group up with member that can't give comitment to the task. I think it is unfair for the team if all the member achieve the same amount of marks (not my team).

### That's all from me. Thank you!
