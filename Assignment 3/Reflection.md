# Reflections
### A. What you have gained
I personally quite enjoy the talk given by Ms. Qistina eventhough it is my first time hearing a company call Credence. The most important aspect for me is I get to know the technology and tools that been used in Credence's system. I gained a lot of new knowledge about how the technology and tools used in Credence's system actually work and what the purpose of each tools.

### B. Suggest any improvement
We need a physical Industrial Talk so that students can engage more with the speaker.

### C. Others
This industrial talk feels a little bit shorter than before. I think it will be better if we can hear talk from another speaker in the same session.

### That's all from me. Thank you!
