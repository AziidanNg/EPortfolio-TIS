# Reflections
### A. What you have gained
Personally, for me, first I would like to thank the Technology and Information System team for giving us the opportunity to visit UTM Digital. This industry visit gives me a clear view of a company that mainly base on computer science. I get to know better what apps, tools are used and the environment inside the company. The visit shows that how important UTM Digital is for all of us UTM people.I can't forget the visit inside the data centre because it my first time in a data centre. 

### B. Suggest any improvement
The industry visit was great, but the improvement that I would make is to change the industry visit is maybe it will be better if we get the opportunity to visit outside company and not a company that heavily related to UTM like UTM Digital

### C. Others
I think Technology and Information System team from the Faculty of Computing should really make industry visit more frequently so us students get to learn more.

### That's all from me. Thank you!
