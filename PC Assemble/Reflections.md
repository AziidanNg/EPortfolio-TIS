### A. What you have gained
I really like practical tasks; that’s why, for me, the PC Assemble Lab session is the best session for the Technology and Information Systems subject. I myself have assembled a PC before this session; that’s why for me it is easy, but my teammate seems to have some difficulty. With my knowledge, I try to get them involved so that they get the experience. The lecturer and lab assistants guided us thoroughly, and they are very friendly. Overall, I really enjoyed the session.

### B. Suggest any improvement
For this PC Assemble Lab session the only improvement I would like to see is students need to take out more component so that the task become more harder for us.

### C. Others
I have an idea: maybe after this, even though it is for learning purposes, we should try to make it more interesting by adding some extra challenge where all the teams that successfully finish early get an extra task to make, such as taking a newer set of PCs and disassembling them to see the difference between old and new PCs.

### That's all from me. Thank you!
